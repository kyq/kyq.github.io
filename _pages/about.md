<p>I'm a researcher learning about Scottish environment and history. Passionate about laser scanning and photogrammetry, I work on reality capture and data processing. Currently, applying IT to the built environment, especially Heritage buildings.</p>

<p>I do research at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a>. I received the MSc degree in Industrial Engineering, majoring in Mechanics, from the <a href="http://www.uclm.es">Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha</a>, Spain, in 2008 and a DEA (Master of Research) in Mechatronics in 2010. In 2013, I obtained a PhD in Engineering from the <a href="http://www.uned.es">UNED</a>, Spain, with a dissertation entitled "Automatic Generation of 3D models with laser scanners and smart technologies". After carrying out different research projects in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> (USA) and <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a> (Belgium), I joined the team <a href="http://web.sbe.hw.ac.uk/fbosche/">Cyberbuild </a>at the Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society School in <a href="https://hw.ac.uk/">Heriot Watt University</a>. In April 2019, our team moved to the <a href="http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk">School of Engineering</a> at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>My research interests include: laser scanning, photogrammetry, 2D/3D data (signal, image and geospatial) processing and representation, Building Information Modelling and RFID technologies.
