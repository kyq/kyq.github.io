Plugin developed as part of the Historic Digital Survey (HDS) research work, which is a tool for CloudCompare that enables the segmentation of dense point clouds (principally from laser scanning) of masonry structures into their individual stones. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/CyberbuildLab/masonry-cc">here </a>.
